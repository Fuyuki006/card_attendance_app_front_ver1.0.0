2023/10/24 Initialize project, I gonna work hard on development from now on! 

2023/10/25 Logo & its style, Reproducting the style was challenging.

2023/10/26 Header & Responsive Design & these styles, First Substantial Responsive Design, I'm still happy when I can.

2023/10/27 Main & Responsive Design & Content Board, I might have forcefully applied some CSS styles. Should I reapply the CSS styles?
I have a lot of things I don't know.

2023/10/29 Content Board style, I had been forcefully setting CSS styles, it's time to relearn. I'll create a new branch and redo the styling.

2023/10/29 Content Board style, I had been forcefully setting CSS styles, it's time to relearn. I'll create a new branch and redo the styling.

2023/10/30 update styles, I managed to make some CSS style adjustments for the Header, although it still feels a bit forced. 

2023/10/31 update main style, I think I've been able to apply the style quite well for now. 

2023/11/01 update styles and implement move pages, I've set up the page navigation for now, 
so should I go ahead and create the next page? I'll also need to make some adjustments to the Index page, 
but for now, let's focus on creating the next one.

2023/11/02 implementation-board-contents, How can I apply different styles to a single element(such as text) in SCSS while using components? It's difficult.

2023/11/03 implementation-board-contents and organizing-folder-structure, I need to rethink the style of the Index page. I think there are many things
I don't know technically. I want to create a TagWall page and get to the DB part as soon as possible. It seems like it will take some time.

2023/11/04 implementation-tagwall-page and redux, In parallel with implementating the TagWall page, I introduced Redux. I'm not sure if using 
Redux for state management is the right choice. or rather, it's a bit challenging. For now, let's give it a try with Redux.

2023/11/05 implementation-tag-and-gridlayout-using-statevalue, Presenting the TagWall section might require some creativity because, when dealing with tags,
it tends to become vertically long.

2023/11/06 implementation-tagwall-header-style-and-registration-button, I'll start creating a modal for registering names. I'm undecided whether
to use an XLSX file or a CSV file when loading data. It looks like I'll need to do some research before deciding.

2023/11/07 implementation-member-registration-modal, I feel like the usage of "state" is not very clean because I'm using "constructor"
 and "useState" separately. Instead of exporting a class, I should have initially exported a function. For now, I'll create a modal.

2023/11/08 implementation-member-registration-modal, Is member addition feature really necessary? I think about UX again.

2023/11/09 change-tag-text-to-inputbox, In the section where I name the tags, I tried switching between Tag Text Edit Mode and Attendance
 Mode for handling input. Is there any creative way to register names ?

2023/11/10 implementation-accordion-button, I made a provisional implementation of a accordion(foldable) button to manually input roster 
data. Spent the whole day on FIgma. Any good ideas for roster registration ?

2023/11/11 implementation-manual-modal, I've been wavering about registering members, but I feel it's login-dependent, so for now, I'll 
work on another section to refresh.

2023/11/12 implementation-login-page, In regards to the login Page, I've started on it. I'll put the member registration part on hold for now,
as it's primarily done through logging in. I'll proceed with implementation while creating the parts that can be designed in Figma.

2023/11/13 implementation-login-page, I've implemented the Login button and Login form. Currently, I'm spending time learning Docker and the backend, which is quite
 challenging.

2023/11/14 ~ 2023/11/23 I've been working on the dev environment during this period. It was challenging to study and bridge the gap 
between the development and production environments. I didn't have time to write dev_note, and there were many hotfixes. From now on, 
I plan to work at my own pace. 

2023/11/25 I was working on a new design in Figma. I need to think about what else is necessary.

2023/11/27 I started creating the menu button. Still a lot to do.

2023/11/28 I was working on a new design in Figma. 

2023/12/01 I implemented chain animation. There is still a lot more to do.

2023/12/02 I splited the chain and move it extensively. I didn't know I could use loops in SCSS. Well, it was a good discovery, 
 so let's leverage it.

2023/12/03 I created a hanging sign, but I realize I need a better understanding of CSS. I need to study more and explore various techniques
 to improve my skills.

2023/12/05 I created a hanging sign, I started to doubt whether this is really necessary. Perhaps it's a flaw in the design process.

2023/12/07 I created a hanging sign, I implemented a pendulum-like animation.

2023/12/08 I was working on a new design in Figma.
