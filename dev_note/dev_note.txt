2023/10/24 Initialize project, I gonna work hard on development from now on! 

2023/10/25 Logo & its style, Reproducting the style was challenging.

2023/10/26 Header & Responsive Design & these styles, First Substantial Responsive Design, I'm still happy when I can.

2023/10/27 Main & Responsive Design & Content Board, I might have forcefully applied some CSS styles. Should I reapply the CSS styles?
I have a lot of things I don't know.

2023/10/29 Content Board style, I had been forcefully setting CSS styles, it's time to relearn. I'll create a new branch and redo the styling.

2023/10/30 update styles, I managed to make some CSS style adjustments for the Header, although it still feels a bit forced. 

2023/10/31 update main style, I think I've been able to apply the style quite well for now. 

2023/11/01 update styles and implement move pages, I've set up the page navigation for now, 
so should I go ahead and create the next page? I'll also need to make some adjustments to the Index page, 
but for now, let's focus on creating the next one.

2023/11/03 implementation-board-contents and organizing-folder-structure, I need to rethink the style of the Index page. I think there are many things
I don't know technically. I want to create a TagWall page and get to the DB part as soon as possible. It seems like it will take some time.

2023/11/04 implementation-tagwall-page and redux, In parallel with implementating the TagWall page, I introduced Redux. I'm not sure if using 
Redux for state management is the right choice. or rather, it's a bit challenging. For now, let's give it a try with Redux.

2023/11/05 implementation-tag-and-gridlayout-using-statevalue, Presenting the TagWall section might require some creativity because, when dealing with tags,
it tends to become vertically long.
