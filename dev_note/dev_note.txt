2023/10/27 Main & Responsive Design & Content Board, I might have forcefully applied some CSS styles. Should I reapply the CSS styles?
I have a lot of things I don't know.

2023/10/29 Content Board style, I had been forcefully setting CSS styles, it's time to relearn. I'll create a new branch and redo the styling.

2023/11/01 update styles and implement move pages, I've set up the page navigation for now, 
so should I go ahead and create the next page? I'll also need to make some adjustments to the Index page, 
but for now, let's focus on creating the next one.
